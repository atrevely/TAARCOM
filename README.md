GenerateMasterGUI.py -- Launches a GUI window that interfaces with GenerateMaster.py in order to process and append new files to the Running Commissions file. New files are selected, then a Principal for the file(s) must be chosen in order to activate processes that are unique to each Principal's file structure. Clicking on the 'Process Files to Running Commissions' button will execute GenerateMaster.py in a new thread, temporarily locking the GUI and updating the user as the file(s) are processed.
